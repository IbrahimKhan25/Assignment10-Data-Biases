Data Biases in Perspective API

CONTENT WARNING: 
The Perspective API is designed for use in content moderation, and the dataset contained very “toxic” comments. Some of the comments in this dataset are racist, sexist, ableist, and offensive. Some comments contain profane language

Assignment 10 - Data biases in the Perspective API that detects toxicity in texts

Found the most common toxic words in the sample csv file and used those to test my hypothesis

My hypothesis: the API does not take context into account, only the toxicity levels of each word

tested phrases that were normally not toxic, but added most common toxic words and tested again to see increased toxicity levels
and vice versa with toxic phrases, adding positive words to see a slightly decreased toxicity level
